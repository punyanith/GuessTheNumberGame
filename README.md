# Overview
Demonstrating the use of a programming language Java in Visual Studio Code by creating a random number generating game that show the basic of a while loop, and an if, elseif statement in Java.

The software will generate a random number for the user to guess. The system will compare the number that the user input to the number that the system has set as the target number. The system will promp the user each time after the user has input their number, whether their guess is too high or too low. Once the number has been guessed, the system will show the user how many tries they have guessed before the correct number. Then the loop continue depending on the user answer, if they choose to continue playing or end the game.

This software is created for learning purposes, to get familair with the pragramming language Java.
